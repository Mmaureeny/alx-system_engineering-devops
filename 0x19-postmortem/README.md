Network outrage in a Telecommunication Company and Resolution

Starting from 7:15pm to EAT, Nov 6th 2022, we experienced a system outage affecting a number of core services on our network.

The issue was realised by an engineer also customers took to social media to vent their frustrations over the outage.
This outage affected Voice, Data, SMS, Mobile money transfer and Enterprise services.

Our engineers identified the root cause of the outage, which was a failure on both our core network as well as our redundancy options.

Our team worked as quickly as possible to resolve the issue and invoked our Business Continuity Planning protocol to restore services and the incident was marked as closed at 11:30pm.

At present, most Voice, Data, SMS, Mobile money transfer and Enterprise services.

We wish to assure our customers that their balances and the integrity of our system are intact.

We apologise for all inconveniences caused.
